        <h2>PLACES OF TOURIST INTEREST</h2>
        <p>Varanasi is historically one of the oldest and the culturally richest religious cities, standing on the western banks of the river Ganges, which assumes the shape of a broad crescent while taking the reverse turn towards the north. Very little compares with the splendor of Varanasi, popularly known as Kashi and Banaras. The rays of the early morning sun, if seen from the river at dawn, greatly enlighten the viewers of Kashi, the City of Light. The temples and shrines, ashrams and pavilions that stretch along the river for almost five kilometers appear to be golden, providing a very pleasant experience. Sarnath is one of the greatest Buddhist Centers and is on the tourist map of the world. It was in Sarnath that Lord Buddha gave his first sermon termed the “Wheel of Law.” The distance of Sarnath from Varanasi is 10 Kms. The Lord Shiva Golden Temple (Kashi Vishwanath), Sankat Mochan Temple, Manasmandir Temple, Durgaji Temple, B.H.U.'s Temple of Lord Shiva, Bharat Mata Mandir, and Ramnagar Fort are also of great tourist attraction.</p>
        <p>Varanasi is well connected by train and air with different parts of the country. </p>

        <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
        <p>By the end of December 2012, the winter session in Varanasi will at climax. The temperature of the city will be in between 15 to 25 Celsius. Participants are requested to bring woolen cloths.</p>
